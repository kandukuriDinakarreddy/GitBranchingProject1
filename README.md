\# AI Media Detection Website

\### (Branching, Merging \& Conflict Resolution Using Git Bash)



\## 📌 Project Description

This project demonstrates the use of Git Bash for branching, merging,

and conflict resolution. A simple web-based prototype is developed that

allows users to upload an image or video and checks whether the media

is likely real or AI-generated using basic logical rules.



The main focus of this project is Git workflow, not AI accuracy.

\## 🔀 Git Workflow Used

\- main / master branch – base project
